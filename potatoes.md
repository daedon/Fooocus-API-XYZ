To store potatoes properly and extend their shelf life, follow these guidelines:

### 1. **Choose the Right Environment**
   - **Cool Temperature**: Store potatoes in a cool place, ideally between 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C). A basement or pantry is often a good choice.
   - **Darkness**: Keep potatoes in the dark to prevent them from turning green and producing solanine, a toxic compound. Light exposure can cause this.
   - **Ventilation**: Store potatoes in a well-ventilated container. Avoid using plastic bags, as they trap moisture. Instead, use paper bags, mesh bags, or a basket that allows air circulation.

### 2. **Avoid Refrigeration**
   - Do not store potatoes in the refrigerator. The cold temperature can cause the starch in potatoes to convert to sugar, resulting in an unpleasant taste and texture.

### 3. **Humidity**
   - Potatoes need some moisture to stay fresh, but too much humidity can cause them to rot. Aim for a moderately humid environment, but ensure it's not too damp.

### 4. **Keep Away from Onions**
   - Store potatoes away from onions. Onions release gases that can cause potatoes to spoil more quickly.

### 5. **Check Regularly**
   - Regularly inspect your stored potatoes for any signs of spoilage. Remove any potatoes that are soft, shriveled, or sprouting to prevent them from affecting the others.

### 6. **Use the Right Varieties**
   - Some potato varieties store better than others. For example, russets and other starchy potatoes tend to store longer than waxy potatoes like red or new potatoes.

### 7. **Avoid Washing Before Storage**
   - Don’t wash potatoes before storing them. Washing introduces moisture, which can lead to rotting. Brush off excess dirt before storing, and wash them just before use.

By following these steps, you can keep your potatoes fresh and usable for a longer period.
